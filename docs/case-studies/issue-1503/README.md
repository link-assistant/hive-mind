# Case Study: Issue #1503 - False positive "Ready to merge" (iteration count as checkCount)

## Summary

The auto-restart-until-mergeable monitor posted a "Ready to merge" comment on
PR xlabtg/teleton-plugins#87 while CI check "Build (SDK with DTS)" was still in progress.
The root cause was that the `watchUntilMergeable` loop passed its total `iteration` counter
as `checkCount` to `getMergeBlockers`, causing the safety valve (`MAX_NO_RUNS_CHECKS=5`)
to fire prematurely after a new commit was pushed.

| 11:39:17   | CI check-runs start (Lint, Build, Test, TypeScript, deploy) |
| 11:40:22   | "Ready to merge" comment posted (FALSE POSITIVE)            |
| 11:39:38   | CI / Build (SDK with DTS) completes (last check)            |

Note: The "Ready to merge" comment at 11:40:22 was posted 44 seconds after all checks
had actually completed at 11:39:38. The screenshot captured the state while CI was still
running (before 11:39:38), showing the inconsistency.

## Root Cause

### Primary: `iteration` used as `checkCount`

In `watchUntilMergeable` (solve.auto-merge.lib.mjs:558), the monitoring loop's `iteration`
counter (total check cycles since process start) was passed directly as `checkCount` to
`getMergeBlockers`:

```javascript
// BEFORE (buggy):
const { blockers } = await getMergeBlockers(owner, repo, prNumber, argv.verbose, iteration);
```

The `checkCount` parameter controls a safety valve in `getMergeBlockers`:

- When `no_checks` + `hasPRTriggers` + `workflowRuns.length === 0`
- If `checkCount >= MAX_NO_RUNS_CHECKS (5)` → conclude "CI was not triggered"

The `iteration` counter increments on EVERY check cycle, regardless of CI state. After 5+
iterations (including iterations where CI was pending/running for a previous commit), any
new push that hadn't registered workflow runs yet would immediately trigger the safety valve.

### Secondary: No SHA change detection

The counter was never reset when the PR's HEAD SHA changed (new push detected). This meant
the counter accumulated across different commits, making the safety valve progressively
less protective with each commit.

### Attack scenario

```
Iteration 1-5: CI pending on commit A (checkCount = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Iteration 6:   New commit B pushed, no workflow runs yet (checkCount = 6)
                → checkCount >= 5 → Safety valve fires
                → "CI was not triggered" (FALSE POSITIVE)
```

## Fix

### 1. Per-SHA consecutive counter (solve.auto-merge.lib.mjs)

Track `consecutiveNoRunsChecks` separately from `iteration`, and reset it when:

- The HEAD SHA changes (new push detected)
- CI checks are found (status is not `no_checks`)

```javascript
// AFTER (fixed):
if (currentHeadSha !== lastKnownHeadSha) {
  lastKnownHeadSha = currentHeadSha;
  consecutiveNoRunsChecks = 0;
  readyToMergeCommentPosted = false;
}
consecutiveNoRunsChecks++;
const { blockers } = await getMergeBlockers(..., consecutiveNoRunsChecks, prBranch);
```

### 2. Branch-aware workflow file parsing (github-merge.lib.mjs)

`checkWorkflowsHavePRTriggers` now accepts an optional `ref` parameter to query workflow
files from the PR branch rather than only the default branch. This ensures the workflow
trigger analysis reflects the actual workflow configuration that will be used for the PR.

### 3. Counter reset on CI state change

When `getMergeBlockers` returns a CI status other than `no_checks` (e.g., `pending`,
`success`, `failure`), the counter is reset to 0. This prevents accumulation across
different CI states.

### 4. Double-check CI confirmation before "Ready to merge" (enhanced)

Before posting "Ready to merge", the system now waits 10 seconds and re-queries both
`getDetailedCIStatus` and `getWorkflowRunsForSha`. If CI has started in the meantime,
the loop continues monitoring instead of posting a false positive. This catches race
conditions where CI starts between the initial check and the merge decision.

### 5. Previous PR commits CI history (enhanced)

When the safety valve reaches `MAX_NO_RUNS_CHECKS=5` with no workflow runs, the system
now checks if previous commits in the same PR had CI runs via `checkPreviousPRCommitsHadCI`.
If they did, the wait is extended to `MAX_NO_RUNS_CHECKS_WITH_CI_HISTORY=10` (double),
since CI should be expected for the current commit too.

### 6. Verbose output through centralized log function (enhanced)

All `console.log` calls in `getMergeBlockers` are now routed through the `log()` function,
ensuring verbose diagnostic output appears in log files for post-mortem analysis (previously
only visible in terminal output, making debugging from log files impossible).

### 7. Enhanced workflow trigger detection (enhanced)

`checkWorkflowsHavePRTriggers` now also detects non-PR trigger types (`workflow_dispatch`,
`schedule`, `repository_dispatch`, `workflow_call`) for diagnostics. This helps distinguish
"workflow exists but won't run on PRs" from "workflow should run on PRs but hasn't started."

## Files Changed

- `src/solve.auto-merge.lib.mjs` — Per-SHA counter, double-check, CI history, verbose logging
- `src/github-merge.lib.mjs` — `checkWorkflowsHavePRTriggers` ref + non-PR trigger detection
- `tests/test-false-positive-iteration-count-1503.mjs` — 20 unit tests (11 original + 9 new)
