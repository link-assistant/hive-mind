## 7. Error Detection
[2025-10-26T22:19:05.483Z] ⚠️ Detected error result from Claude CLI
[2025-10-26T22:19:05.494Z] ❌ Claude command failed with exit code 0

## Key Observations:
1. The PDF file was successfully downloaded (1.1MB)
2. The PDF was successfully read by the Read tool
3. The PDF content was transmitted as base64 to the API
4. The failure occurred due to "tool use concurrency issues" NOT "PDF file read failed"
5. This is an API-level error (400 status code)
6. The actual root cause is unrelated to PDF reading itself
