{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","is_bot":false,"login":"konard","name":"Konstantin Diachenko"},"body":"https://github.com/link-assistant/hive-mind/pull/843 - here was the first interactive mode run.\n\nWe need to make several improvements.\n\n1. No need for tool id in the comment, we have it in Raw JSON.\n2. No need to write info about tokens, we have it in Raw JSON.\n3. No need for header in regular agent response, just write the message, and collapsed raw JSON after `---` separator.\n4. If we have the same tool use, we should write tool use call in the first message, and after that if we get result for that tool we should just update already existing comment. And we should merge raw json from both call and result into single array of json objects.\n5. All Raw JSON should be arrays (in the root), even if they contain only single object, so it will be easier to merge them if needed.\n6. Comment title should be updated \"Session Started\" -> \"Interactive session Started\", also in this comment we should show selected model in properties. The same for `permissionMode`, and `claude_code_version`, we should show them nicely too. Also for `mcp_servers`, `slash_commands` and `agents`.\n7. `💻 Tool: Bash` -> `💻 Tool use: Bash`\n8. Todos should have up to 30 items without skipping, and if we do skip items, we should skip them in the middle (not at the end).\n    ``` 📋 Todos (10 items)\n     Research Claude CLI stdin input capabilities and NDJSON streaming\n     Study existing interactive-mode.lib.mjs implementation\n     Explore experiments folder for related work on interactive mode\n     Design comment monitoring and input queuing mechanism\n     Implement PR comment watcher that monitors for new user comments\n    ...and 5 more\n    ```\n\n\nPlease download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to `./docs/case-studies` folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.","createdAt":"2025-12-05T19:12:24Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOPUU0qc8AAAACGYm6jw","name":"documentation","description":"Improvements or additions to documentation","color":"0075ca"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPUU0qc8AAAACGYm6mA","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"number":844,"state":"OPEN","title":"Interactive mode output improvements","url":"https://github.com/link-assistant/hive-mind/issues/844"}
